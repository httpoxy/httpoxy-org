## Disclosure site

This is a static Jekyll site, so you'll need:

* Ruby >= 2.2
* Bundler

To get started, do:

* `bundle install` (wait as bundler installs literally the entire world)
* `bundle exec jekyll serve`

Which will serve a local development version of the site.

The CI scripts in `./ci` provide handy shortcuts. (e.g. `./ci/watch`)

### Aims

* Single page, one css file, one image (index.md)
* Simple, clear language
* As many examples as we can muster
* Highlighted code
* Ready at a moment's notice in case of early disclosure
