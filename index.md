*httpoxy* is a set of vulnerabilities that affect application code running in CGI, or CGI-like environments. It comes
down to a simple namespace conflict:
{: .lead}

* RFC 3875 (CGI) puts the HTTP `Proxy` header from a request into the environment variables as `HTTP_PROXY`
* `HTTP_PROXY` is a popular environment variable used to configure an outgoing proxy
{: .lead}

This leads to a remotely exploitable vulnerability. If you're running PHP or CGI, you should block the `Proxy` header.
[Here's how.](#fix-now)
{: .lead}

httpoxy is a vulnerability for server-side web applications. If you're not deploying code, you don't need to worry.

#### What can happen if my web application is vulnerable?

If a vulnerable HTTP client makes an outgoing HTTP connection, while running in a server-side CGI application, an
attacker may be able to:

* Proxy the outgoing HTTP requests made by the web application
* Direct the server to open outgoing connections to an address and port of their choosing
* Tie up server resources by forcing the vulnerable software to use a malicious proxy

httpoxy is extremely easy to exploit in basic form. And we expect security
researchers to be able to scan for it quickly. Luckily, if you read on and
find you are affected, [easy mitigations](#fix-now) are available.


## Isn't this old news? Is this still a problem?
{: .section}

httpoxy **was disclosed in mid-2016**. If you're reading about it now for the first time, you can _probably_ relax and
take your time reading about this quaint historical bug that _hopefully_ no longer affects any of the applications you
maintain. But you should verify that to your own satisfaction.

The content below this point reflects the original disclosure, and I'll be leaving the site up and mostly unchanged, other
than noting fix versions where I can. I guess I'm just saying: the time for urgency was last year.



## What Is Affected {#affected-summary}
{: .section}

A few things are necessary to be vulnerable:

* Code running under a CGI-like context, where `HTTP_PROXY` becomes a real or emulated environment variable
* An HTTP client that trusts `HTTP_PROXY`, and configures it as the proxy
* That client, used within a request handler, making an HTTP (as opposed to HTTPS) request

For example, the confirmed cases we've found so far:

Language | Environment | HTTP client
--- | --- | ---
PHP | php-fpm <br /> mod_php | Guzzle 4+ <br /> Artax
Python | wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler <br /> twisted.web.twcgi.CGIScript | requests
Go | net/http/cgi | net/http
{: .table}

But obviously there may be languages we haven't considered yet. CGI is a common standard, and
`HTTP_PROXY` seems to be becoming more popular over time. Take the below as a sample of the most
commonly affected scenarios:


### PHP

* Whether you are vulnerable depends on your specific application code and PHP libraries, but the problem
  seems fairly widespread
* Just _using_ one of the vulnerable libraries, while processing a user's request, is exploitable.
* If you're using a vulnerable library, this vulnerability will affect any version of PHP
    * It even affects alternative PHP runtimes such as HHVM deployed under FastCGI
* It is present in Guzzle, Artax, and probably many, many libraries
    * Guzzle versions in the range `>=4.0.0rc2,<6.2.1` are vulnerable, Guzzle 3 and below is not.
    * Another example is (update: was) in Composer's StreamContextBuilder utility class

So, for example, if you are using a Drupal module that uses Guzzle `6.2.0` and makes an outgoing HTTP request (for example,
to check a weather API), you are vulnerable to the request that plugin makes being "httpoxied".

### Python

* Python code *must be deployed under CGI to be vulnerable*. Usually, that'll mean the vulnerable code
will use a CGI handler like `wsgiref.handlers.CGIHandler`
  * This is not considered a normal way of deploying Python webapps (most people are using WSGI or FastCGI, both of which are
  not affected), so vulnerable Python applications will probably be much rarer than vulnerable PHP applications.
  * wsgi, for example, is not vulnerable, because os.environ is not polluted by CGI data
* Vulnerable versions of the requests library will trust and use `os.environ['HTTP_PROXY']`, without checking if CGI is in use
* Update: Fixed in `2.7.13`, `3.4.6`, `3.5.3`, `3.6.0` (see [the Python advisory](https://python-security.readthedocs.io/vuln/cve-2016-1000110_httpoxy_attack.html))

### Go

* Go code *must be deployed under CGI to be vulnerable*. Usually, that'll mean the vulnerable code uses
the `net/http/cgi` package.
  * As with Python, this is not considered a usual way of deploying Go as a web application, so this vulnerability should be
  relatively rare
  * Go's `net/http/fcgi` package, by comparison, does not set actual environment variables, so it is *not* vulnerable
* Vulnerable versions of `net/http` will trust and use `HTTP_PROXY` for outgoing requests, without checking if CGI is in use
* Update: Fixed in Go `1.7rc3`, all stable versions of `>=1.7`







## Immediate Mitigation {#fix-now}
{: .section}

The best immediate mitigation is to block `Proxy` request headers as early as possible, and before they hit your
application. This is easy and safe.
{: .lead}

* It's safe because the `Proxy` header is undefined by the IETF, and isn't listed on the
[IANA's registry of message headers](http://www.iana.org/assignments/message-headers/message-headers.xhtml). This means
<strong>there is no standard use for the header at all</strong>; not even a provisional use-case.
* Standards-compliant HTTP clients and servers will never read or send this header.
* You can either strip the header or completely block requests attempting to use it.
* You should try to do your mitigation as *early* and as far *upstream* as you can.
    * Do it "at the edge", where HTTP requests first enter your system.
    * That way, you can fix lots of vulnerable software at once.
    * Everything behind a reverse proxy or application firewall that strips the `Proxy` header is safe!

How you block a `Proxy` header depends on the specifics of your setup. The earliest convenient place to block the header
might be at a web application firewall device, or directly on the webserver running Apache or NGINX. Here are a few of
the more common mitigations:


### NGINX/FastCGI {#mitigate-nginx}

Use this to block the header from being passed on to PHP-FPM, PHP-PM etc.

```
fastcgi_param HTTP_PROXY "";
```

In FastCGI configurations, PHP is vulnerable (but many other languages that use NGINX FastCGI are not).

For specific NGINX coverage, we recommend that you read the official [NGINX blog post](https://www.nginx.com/blog/mitigating-the-httpoxy-vulnerability-with-nginx)
on this vulnerability. The blog post provides a graphic depiction of how
httpoxy works and more extensive mitigation information for NGINX.

### Apache {#mitigate-apache}

For specific Apache coverage (and details for other Apache software projects like Tomcat), we strongly recommend
you read the [Apache Software Foundation's official advisory](https://www.apache.org/security/asf-httpoxy-response.txt) on
the matter. The very basic mitigation information you'll find below is covered in much greater depth there.

If you're using Apache HTTP Server with `mod_cgi`, languages like Go and Python may be vulnerable (the `HTTP_PROXY` env var
is "real"). And `mod_php` is affected due to the nature of PHP. If you are using **mod_headers**, you can unset the
`Proxy` header before further processing with this directive:

```
RequestHeader unset Proxy early
```

Example for using this in `.htaccess` files:

```
<IfModule mod_headers.c>
   RequestHeader unset Proxy
</IfModule>
```

If you are using **mod_security**, you can use a `SecRule` to deny traffic with a `Proxy` header. Here's an example,
vary the action to taste, and make sure `SecRuleEngine` is on. The 1000005 ID has been assigned to this issue.

```
SecRule &REQUEST_HEADERS:Proxy "@gt 0" "id:1000005,log,deny,msg:'httpoxy denied'"
```

Finally, if you're using Apache Traffic Server, it's not itself affected, but you can use it to strip the `Proxy` header; very helpful
for any services sitting behind it. Again, see the [ASF's guidance](https://www.apache.org/security/asf-httpoxy-response.txt),
but one possible configuration is:

* Within `plugin.config`, inside the configuration directory (e.g. `/usr/local/etc/trafficserver` or `/etc/trafficserver`),
  add the following directive:

  ```
  header_rewrite.so strip_proxy.conf
  ```

* Add the following to a new file named `strip_proxy.conf` in the same directory:

  ```
  cond %{READ_REQUEST_HDR_HOOK}
  rm-header Proxy
  ```

### HAProxy {#mitigate-haproxy}

This will strip the header off requests:

```
http-request del-header Proxy
```

If your version of HAProxy is old (i.e. `1.4` or earlier), you may not have the `http-request del-header` directive.
If so, you must also take care that headers are stripped from requests served after the first one over an HTTP 1.1
keep-alive connection. (i.e. take special note of the limitation described in the first paragraph of [the 1.4 "header
manipulation" documentation](https://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/1.4/configuration.html#6))

### Varnish {#mitigate-varnish}

For Varnish, the following should unset the header. Add it to the pre-existing vcl_recv section:

```
sub vcl_recv {
    [...]
    unset req.http.proxy;
    [...]
}
```

### OpenBSD relayd {#mitigate-relayd}

For relayd, the following should remove the header. Add it to a pre-existing filter:

```
http protocol httpfilter {
        match request header remove "Proxy"
}
```

### lighttpd {#mitigate-lighttpd}

#### <= 1.4.40

To reject requests containing a `Proxy` header

* Create `/path/to/deny-proxy.lua`, read-only to lighttpd, with the content:

  ```
  if (lighty.request["Proxy"] == nil) then return 0 else return 403 end
  ```

* Modify `lighttpd.conf` to load `mod_magnet` and run the above lua code:

  ```
  server.modules += ( "mod_magnet" )
  magnet.attract-raw-url-to = ( "/path/to/deny-proxy.lua" )
  ```

#### lighttpd2 (development)

To strip the `Proxy` header from the request, add the following to `lighttpd.conf`:

```
req_header.remove "Proxy";
```

### Microsoft IIS with PHP or a CGI framework {#mitigate-iis}

For detailed information about mitigating httpoxy on IIS, you should
head to the official [Microsoft article KB3179800](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3179800), which covers
the below mitigations in greater detail.

Also important to know: httpoxy does not affect any Microsoft Web Frameworks, e.g. not ASP.NET nor Active Server Pages.
But if you have installed PHP or any other third party framework on top of IIS, we recommend applying mitigation steps
to protect from httpoxy attacks. You can either block requests containing a `Proxy` header, or clear the header. (The header
is safe to block, because browsers will not generally send it at all).

To _block_ requests that contain a `Proxy` header (the preferred solution), run the following command line.

```
appcmd set config /section:requestfiltering /+requestlimits.headerLimits.[header='proxy',sizelimit='0']
```

**Note:** `appcmd.exe` is not typically in the path and can be found in the `%systemroot%\system32\inetsrv` directory

To _clear_ the value of the header, use the following URL Rewrite rule:

```xml
<system.webServer>
    <rewrite>
        <rules>
            <rule name="Erase HTTP_PROXY" patternSyntax="Wildcard">
                <match url="*.*" />
                <serverVariables>
                    <set name="HTTP_PROXY" value="" />
                </serverVariables>
                <action type="None" />
            </rule>
        </rules>
    </rewrite>
</system.webServer>
```

**Note:** URL Rewrite is a downloadable add-in for IIS and is not included in a default IIS installation.

### Hiawatha

You can block any request containing a `Proxy` header (or ban the sending client) via the UrlToolkit:

```
UrlToolkit {
  ToolkitID = block_httpoxy
  Header Proxy .* DenyAccess
}
```

See more information at the [hiawatha blog](https://www.hiawatha-webserver.org/weblog/115)

### LiteSpeed Web Server

Upgrade to `>= 5.0.19` or `>= 5.1.7` to mitigate. You can do this manually with one of these commands, or you'll get
an upgrade notification soon.

```sh
/usr/local/lsws/admin/misc/lsup.sh -v 5.0.19 # or
/usr/local/lsws/admin/misc/lsup.sh -v 5.1.7
```

See more information at the [litespeed blog](http://blog.litespeedtech.com/2016/07/18/the-httpoxy-vulnerability-has-been-taken-care-of-by-litespeed-automatically/)

### h2o Web Server

Upgrade to `>= 2.0.2` and add this to your configuration:

```
setenv:
  HTTP_PROXY: ""
```

More information can be found in this [GitHub pull request](https://github.com/h2o/h2o/pull/996).

### Other CGI software and applications

Please let us know of other places where httpoxy is found. We'd be happy to help you communicate fixes for your platform,
server or library if you are affected. Contact [contact@httpoxy.org](mailto:contact@httpoxy.org?subject=Fix) to let us
know. Or create a PR or issue against the [httpoxy-org repo](https://github.com/httpoxy/httpoxy-org) in GitHub.





## Ineffective fixes in PHP {#php-nope}
{: .section}

Userland PHP fixes don't work. Don't bother:

* Using `unset($_SERVER['HTTP_PROXY'])` does not affect the value returned from `getenv()`, so is not an effective
  mitigation
* Using `putenv('HTTP_PROXY=')` does not work either (to be precise: it only works if that value is coming from an
  actual environment variable rather than a header -- so, it cannot be used for mitigation)










## Prevention {#prevent}
{: .section}

### Summary

* If you can avoid it, do not deploy into environments where the CGI data is merged into the actual environment variables
* Use and expect `CGI_HTTP_PROXY` to set the proxy for a CGI application's internal requests, if necessary
    * You can still support `HTTP_PROXY`, but you must assert that CGI is not in use
    * In PHP, check `PHP_SAPI == 'cli'`
    * Otherwise, a simple check is to not trust `HTTP_PROXY` if `REQUEST_METHOD` is also set. RFC 3875 seems to require
      this meta-variable:

      {:.blockquote}
      > <p class="m-b-0" markdown="1">
      >  The `REQUEST_METHOD` meta-variable MUST be set to the method which should be used by the script to process the request
      > </p>

### Don't Trust `HTTP_PROXY` Under CGI

To put it plainly: there is no way to trust the value of an `HTTP_` env var in a CGI environment. They cannot be
distinguished from request headers according to the specification. So, _any_ usage of `HTTP_PROXY` in a CGI context is
suspicious.

If you need to configure the proxy of a CGI application via an environment variable, use a variable name that will
never conflict with request headers. That is: one that does not begin with `HTTP_`. We strongly recommend you go for
`CGI_HTTP_PROXY`. (As seen in Ruby and libwww-perl's mitigations for this issue.)

### PHP {#prevent-php}

CLI-only code may safely trust `$_SERVER['HTTP_PROXY']` or `getenv('HTTP_PROXY')`. But bear in mind that code written
for the CLI context often ends up running in a SAPI eventually, particularly utility or library code. And, with open
source code, that might not even be your doing. So, if you are going to rely on `HTTP_PROXY` at all, you should guard
that code with a check of the `PHP_SAPI` constant.

### Network Configuration as Prevention

A defense-in-depth strategy that can combat httpoxy (and entire classes of other security problems) is to severely restrict
the outgoing requests your web application can make to an absolute minimum. For example, if a web application is
firewalled in such a way that it *cannot* make outgoing HTTP requests, an attacker will not be able to receive
the "misproxied" requests (because the web application is prevented from connecting to the attacker).

### HTTPS

And, of course, another defense-in-depth strategy that works is to use HTTPS for internal requests, not just for
securing your site's connections to the outside world. HTTPS requests aren't affected by `HTTP_PROXY`.





## How It Works {#how-it-works}
{: .section}

Using PHP as an example, because it is illustrative. PHP has a method called `getenv()`[^php-getenv].

There is a common vulnerability in many PHP libraries and applications, introduced by confusing
`getenv` for a method that only returns environment variables. In fact, getenv() is closer to the
`$_SERVER` superglobal: it contains both environment variables and user-controlled data.

Specifically, when PHP is running under a CGI-like server, the HTTP request headers (data supplied
 by the client) are merged into the `$_SERVER` superglobal under keys beginning with `HTTP_`. This is
 the same information that `getenv` reads from.

When a user sends a request with a `Proxy` header, the header appears to the PHP application as `getenv('HTTP_PROXY')`.
Some common PHP libraries have been trusting this value, even when run in a CGI/SAPI environment.

Reading and trusting `$_SERVER['HTTP_PROXY']` is exactly the same vulnerability, but tends to happen much less often
(perhaps because of getenv's name, perhaps because the semantics of the `$_SERVER` superglobal are better understood among
the community).

### Minimal example code {#examples}

Note that these examples require deployment into a vulnerable environment before there is actually a vulnerability
(e.g. php-fpm, or Apache's `ScriptAlias`)

#### PHP

```php?start_inline=1
$client = new GuzzleHttp\Client();
$client->get('http://api.internal/?secret=foo')
```

#### Python

```python
from wsgiref.handlers import CGIHandler
def application(environ, start_response):
    requests.get("http://api.internal/?secret=foo")
CGIHandler().run(application)
```

#### Go

```go
cgi.Serve(
    http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        res, _ := http.Get("http://api.internal/?secret=foo")
        // [...]
```

More complete PoC repos (using Docker, and testing with an actual listener for the proxied request) have been prepared
under the [httpoxy Github organization](https://github.com/httpoxy).






## Why It Happened {#why}
{: .section}

Under the CGI spec, headers are provided mixed into the environment variables. (These are formally known as
"Protocol-Specific Meta-Variables"[^meta-variables]). That's just the way the spec works, not a failure or bug.

The goal of the code, in most of the vulnerabilities, is to find the correct proxy to use, when auto-configuring a
client for the internal  HTTP request made shortly after. This task in Ruby could be completed by
the `find_proxy` method of `URI::Generic`, which notes:

> <p class="m-b-0" markdown="1">
>
> `http_proxy` and `HTTP_PROXY` are treated specially under the CGI environment, because `HTTP_PROXY` may be set by Proxy:
> header. So `HTTP_PROXY` is not used. `http_proxy` is not used too if the variable is case insensitive. `CGI_HTTP_PROXY`
> can be used instead.
>
> </p>
> <footer class="blockquote-footer">
> From the <cite title="Source Title"><a href="http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-2.3.1/libdoc/uri/rdoc/URI/Generic.html#method-i-find_proxy">Ruby stdlib documentation</a></cite>
> </footer>
{: .blockquote}

Other instances of the same vulnerability are present in other languages. For example, when
using Go's `net/http/cgi` module, and deploying as a CGI application. This indicates the vulnerability
is a standard danger in CGI environments.

 </dd>
</dl>

So, the bug was lying dormant for years, like a latent infection: pox. We imagine that many people may have found the issue over
the years, but never investigated its scope in other languages and libraries. If you've found a historical discussion
of interest that we've missed, let us know. You can contact [contact@httpoxy.org](mailto:contact@httpoxy.org?subject=History)
or create an issue against the [httpoxy-org repo](https://github.com/httpoxy/httpoxy-org).



## CVEs    {#cve}
{: .section}

httpoxy has a number of CVEs assigned. These cover the cases where

* a language or CGI implementation makes the `Proxy` header available in such a way that the application cannot tell whether
  it is a real environment variable, or
* an application trusts the value of the `HTTP_PROXY` environment variable by default in a CGI environment (but only where that application should have been
able to tell it came from a request)

The assigned CVEs so far:

* CVE-2016-5385: PHP
* CVE-2016-5386: Go
* CVE-2016-5387: Apache HTTP Server
* CVE-2016-5388: Apache Tomcat
* CVE-2016-6286: spiffy-cgi-handlers for CHICKEN
* CVE-2016-6287: CHICKEN's http-client
* CVE-2016-1000104: mod_fcgi
* CVE-2016-1000105: Nginx cgi script
* CVE-2016-1000107: Erlang inets
* CVE-2016-1000108: YAWS
* CVE-2016-1000109: HHVM FastCGI
* CVE-2016-1000110: Python CGIHandler
* CVE-2016-1000111: Python Twisted
* CVE-2016-1000212: lighttpd

We suspect there may be more CVEs coming for httpoxy, as less common software is checked over. If you
want to get a CVE assigned for an httpoxy issue, there are a couple of options:

  - For open source code projects, you can use the [Distributed Weakness Filing Project](https://distributedweaknessfiling.org/) (DWF).
    They have a simple way to report (public) issues using the form at [iwantacve.org](https://iwantacve.org/)
  - For closed source code projects, you can talk to [MITRE, or one of their participating CNAs/vendors/coordinators](https://cve.mitre.org/cve/cna.html).
